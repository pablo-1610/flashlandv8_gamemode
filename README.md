# FlashLand V8 Gamemode

**Warning**: Please read and respect the license of the project, otherwise you could expose yourself to the deletion of your repo or the restriction of your account.

## Why did you publish it?

This project was initially the revolutionary project for the FlashLand server, it was about creating a brand new version
and therefore, a brand new game experience.

Unfortunately, despite a huge investment in time, Vibr1cy and I were not able to meet the deadlines imposed, the V8
project was abandoned and we left the project.

Obviously, not having kept our deadline, we were not paid for this work (I asked for it personally), this work is
rightfully ours, so we decided today to publish it to serve as an example and to allow those who want to improve to do
so with a knowledge base.

However, neither I nor Vibr1cy are responsible for the use that will be made of this gamemode, and we are also not
responsible for the problems or difficulties that you could be brought to meet while using it.

## Install:

**Put into your cfg file:**
```cfg
set flashland_db "server=IP_DATABASE;database=NAME_DATABASE;userid=USER_DATABASE;password=PASSWORD_DATABASE"

ensure flashlandv8_gamemode
```
